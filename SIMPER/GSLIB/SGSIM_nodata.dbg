 
 Covariance Look up table and search for previously
 simulated grid nodes.  The maximum range in each 
 coordinate direction for covariance look up is:
           X direction:         6.250000
           Y direction:         6.250000
           Z direction:     0.000000E+00
 Node Values are not searched beyond this distance!
 

 Realization   1: number   =    20301
                  mean     =      -0.0973 (close to 0.0?)
                  variance =       1.0327 (close to gammabar(V,V)? approx. 1.0)
