 
 Covariance Look up table and search for previously
 simulated grid nodes.  The maximum range in each 
 coordinate direction for covariance look up is:
           X direction:     0.000000E+00
           Y direction:     0.000000E+00
           Z direction:     0.000000E+00
 Node Values are not searched beyond this distance!
